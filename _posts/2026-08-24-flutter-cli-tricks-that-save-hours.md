## Introduction

The Flutter CLI is the engine behind everything you do in Flutter development. Most developers know `flutter run`, `flutter build`, and `flutter pub get`. But the CLI goes much deeper than that.

Knowing these tricks doesn't just save seconds — it removes friction from your daily workflow and gives you finer control over how your app behaves during development.

---

## 1. Run on a Specific Device Without Prompts

When you have multiple devices connected, `flutter run` asks you to choose. Skip the prompt:

```bash
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

List all connected devices first:

```bash
flutter devices
```

Pro tip: assign short aliases in your shell profile:

```bash
alias frd='flutter run -d emulator-5554'
```

---

## 2. Hot Reload vs Hot Restart: Know the Difference

While the app is running in terminal:

- `r` — **Hot Reload**: injects updated code while preserving app state
- `R` — **Hot Restart**: restarts the Dart VM, resets all state
- `q` — Quits the app

Use hot reload for UI tweaks. Use hot restart when you've changed `initState()`, providers, or app initialization logic.

---

## 3. Build with Release Flags for Performance Testing

Never judge performance on a debug build. Debug builds include asserts, overflow checks, and debugging overhead.

```bash
# Test true performance
flutter run --release

# Profile mode — release performance + DevTools support
flutter run --profile
```

An app that feels sluggish in debug mode might be perfectly smooth in release. Always profile in profile mode, not debug.

---

## 4. Filter Flutter Logs by Tag

The Flutter debug console can be noisy. Filter output:

```bash
flutter run 2>&1 | grep "flutter:"
```

Or use `--verbose` when you need the full picture for a crash:

```bash
flutter run --verbose
```

---

## 5. Generate a `pubspec.lock` Snapshot for Reproducible Builds

When sharing a project with a team, ensure everyone builds with the same package versions:

```bash
flutter pub get  # Generates pubspec.lock
```

Commit `pubspec.lock` to version control. This ensures CI and teammates use identical dependency versions.

---

## 6. Analyze Code Without Running the App

Catch errors, unused imports, and lint violations before running:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

This runs faster than building and surfaces issues your IDE might miss.

---

## 7. Format Your Entire Project

Keep formatting consistent across the whole codebase:

```bash
dart format .
```

Or check what would change without applying:

```bash
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
```

This second form is useful in CI to fail the pipeline when unformatted code is committed.

---

## 8. Upgrade Packages Safely

Check what's outdated:

```bash
flutter pub outdated
```

Upgrade within constraints defined in `pubspec.yaml`:

```bash
flutter pub upgrade
```

Upgrade to the latest regardless of constraints (use with caution):

```bash
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
```

---

## 9. Clean Up When Things Get Weird

When builds behave unexpectedly — missing assets, cached type errors, strange compilation failures:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

This clears the build cache and forces a full rebuild. Takes longer but eliminates most mysterious build issues.

---

## 10. Build for Specific Platforms with One Command

```bash
# Android APK
flutter build apk --release

# Android App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release

# iOS (requires macOS + Xcode)
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web --release

# Split APK by ABI (smaller download sizes on Play Store)
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```

---

## 11. Run Tests from the CLI

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run a specific test file
flutter test test/unit/auth_test.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

View coverage results:

```bash
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

---

## 12. Create a New Flutter Project with a Custom Organization

```bash
flutter create --org com.yourcompany yourapp
```

This sets the bundle ID correctly from the start, avoiding the common headache of renaming it later.

---

## Conclusion

The Flutter CLI is a precision instrument that most developers only use at 20% capacity.

Learning these commands doesn't require studying documentation for hours. It requires one new flag per day, applied to something you're already doing.

Over time, these small efficiencies compound into hours saved every week.
