## Introduction

Most Flutter developers build for phones first — and only think about tablets and desktops when they have to.

But Flutter is uniquely positioned to target all screen sizes from a single codebase. Achieving this isn't about special packages or complex frameworks. It's about a disciplined approach to how you measure space and make layout decisions.

---

## The Wrong Approach: Hardcoded Dimensions

The fastest path to a broken layout is hardcoding pixel values:

```dart
// ❌ Breaks on anything but the device you tested on
Container(
  width: 390,
  height: 844,
  child: ...,
)
```

A phone is 390px wide. A tablet is 768px. A desktop is 1440px. Hardcoded values satisfy exactly one of these.

---

## The Foundation: `MediaQuery`

`MediaQuery.of(context)` gives you the actual dimensions of the device screen:

```dart
final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
final screenHeight = MediaQuery.of(context).size.height;
```

Use percentages of the available space rather than fixed values:

```dart
// ✅ Scales correctly across all screen sizes
Container(
  width: screenWidth * 0.9,
  padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(
    horizontal: screenWidth * 0.05,
  ),
  child: ...,
)
```

---

## Define Breakpoints

Establish clear thresholds for different screen categories:

```dart
class ScreenSize {
  static bool isPhone(BuildContext context) =>
      MediaQuery.of(context).size.width < 600;

  static bool isTablet(BuildContext context) =>
      MediaQuery.of(context).size.width >= 600 &&
      MediaQuery.of(context).size.width < 1024;

  static bool isDesktop(BuildContext context) =>
      MediaQuery.of(context).size.width >= 1024;
}
```

These breakpoints align with Flutter's own platform guidelines and common device categories.

---

## Adapting Layouts with `LayoutBuilder`

`LayoutBuilder` provides the constraints of the parent widget, giving you more precise control than `MediaQuery`:

```dart
LayoutBuilder(
  builder: (context, constraints) {
    if (constraints.maxWidth < 600) {
      return const PhoneLayout();
    } else if (constraints.maxWidth < 1024) {
      return const TabletLayout();
    } else {
      return const DesktopLayout();
    }
  },
)
```

`LayoutBuilder` is preferred over `MediaQuery` for individual component layouts because it responds to the space available *where the widget is placed*, not the entire screen.

---

## Responsive Grids with `GridView`

Replace fixed-column grids with adaptive ones:

```dart
// ❌ Always 2 columns regardless of screen size
GridView.count(crossAxisCount: 2, ...)

// ✅ Adapts column count to available width
GridView.builder(
  gridDelegate: const SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent(
    maxCrossAxisExtent: 200,
    crossAxisSpacing: 16,
    mainAxisSpacing: 16,
  ),
  ...
)
```

`SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent` automatically calculates how many columns fit without you specifying a count.

---

## Fluid Typography

Text sizes should scale with the device, not stay fixed:

```dart
double responsiveFontSize(BuildContext context, double base) {
  final width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
  if (width < 600) return base;
  if (width < 1024) return base * 1.2;
  return base * 1.4;
}

// Usage
Text(
  'Hello',
  style: TextStyle(fontSize: responsiveFontSize(context, 16)),
)
```

---

## Safe Areas and Notches

Always wrap your top-level layout in `SafeArea` to avoid overlap with system UI:

```dart
Scaffold(
  body: SafeArea(
    child: YourContent(),
  ),
)
```

On devices with notches, dynamic islands, or bottom navigation bars, `SafeArea` inserts the correct padding automatically.

---

## Adaptive Navigation

On phones, a `BottomNavigationBar` makes sense. On tablets and desktops, a `NavigationRail` or `Drawer` is more appropriate:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final isWide = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width >= 600;

  return Scaffold(
    body: Row(
      children: [
        if (isWide)
          NavigationRail(
            destinations: _destinations,
            selectedIndex: _selectedIndex,
            onDestinationSelected: (i) => setState(() => _selectedIndex = i),
          ),
        Expanded(child: _screens[_selectedIndex]),
      ],
    ),
    bottomNavigationBar: isWide
        ? null
        : BottomNavigationBar(
            items: _destinations.map((d) => BottomNavigationBarItem(
              icon: d.icon,
              label: d.label,
            )).toList(),
            currentIndex: _selectedIndex,
            onTap: (i) => setState(() => _selectedIndex = i),
          ),
  );
}
```

## Testing Responsive Layouts

In Flutter DevTools and the Android emulator, you can resize the window or switch between device profiles to test layouts without owning every device.

Use the **Flutter Inspector** to visualize layout boundaries and confirm widgets are occupying the expected space.

---

## Conclusion

A responsive Flutter app isn't a phone app that happens to run on a tablet. It's a layout system that consciously adapts to whatever space it's given.

The tools are all built in — `MediaQuery`, `LayoutBuilder`, `SafeArea`, adaptive navigation. The only thing required is the habit of designing with all screen sizes in mind from the beginning.

Build once. Work everywhere.
